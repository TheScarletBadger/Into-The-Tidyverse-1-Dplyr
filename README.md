This repo contains 3 simple R scripts which demonstrate applications of the dplyr package. I have also uploaded 2 sample datasets (rocky.csv and rocky2.csv) which the scripts use. Please not that you will have to install the tidyverse and knitr packages for these to work. Also remember to change the paths in readcsv functions to where you have stored the sample data files.
